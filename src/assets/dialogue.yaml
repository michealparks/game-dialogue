      Excellent. Just remember that we will need to enter our instructions in
      the form of a numerical distance and cardinal direction (such as N for
      north, S for south, etc.) We will use the rosary beads as a scale for
      distance, so if you want me to go 7 beads west, for example, you can give

          Excellent work, as always. I knew I could count on you to figure this
          out. We’re going to contact The Emerens Institute to find out if they
          have anything in their archives from that location. Thank you for your
          diligence.

      Well, the Town Hall is quite a big space, so we’ve got a lot of searching
      ahead of us. If we discover anything there, I hope you’ll be available to
      assist us with our findings. Thank you again for all your help!
